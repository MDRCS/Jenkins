# - Jenkins

- This Repo Provide ways of setting up Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and different Groovy Scripts.

### 1- Jenkins Blue Ocean Features:


    + Jenkins Blue Ocean comes with an embedded tool called the Visual Pipeline Editor. 
      This tool allows users to create and edit their pipeline.
      visually using a UI interface thatâ€™s accessible directly from the pipeline dashboard. 
      Also, the Visual Pipeline Editor saves your pipeline in code inside a file (Jenkinsfile), 
      following the Declarative Pipeline Syntax, directly to your source code repository.
      
    + The pipeline visualization allows users to diagnose pipeline failures with ease and speed. 
      When a pipeline fails, Blue Ocean tells you exactly where it has failed by pointing out the failed step. 
      Also, the pipeline logs are displayed individually for every stage and step of a pipeline, 
      so that users do not end up scrolling through a single huge log.

    + Blue Ocean also creates separate pages to view your testing results and built artifacts for every pipeline run.

### 2- Installing Jenkins Blue Ocean :

    + You can install Blue Ocean in the following two ways:
      1- As a suite of plugins on an existing Jenkins installation
      2- As part of Jenkins in Docker.
    
    + To run Jenkins from Docker Image :
    -> A docker image to give BlueOcean a try

    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkinsci/blueocean
    1- note the admin password dumped on log
    2- open a browser on http://localhost:8080
    3- run the initial setup wizard. Choose "recommended plugins"
    4- browse to http://localhost:8080/blue

### 3- Visual Pipeline Editor :

    + When you create a pipeline in Blue Ocean, it automatically saves your pipeline design as pipeline code, 
     which is saved as a Jenkinsfile inside your source control repository.
